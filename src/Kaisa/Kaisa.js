        <p>
          A talent from abroad, Kai'Sa brings a unique style and sound to the
          industry. She learned to express herself through her craft, blossoming
          into one of the most talented dancers in the worldâ€”a perfect fit for
          the misfits of K/DA, where she takes their performances to the next
          level. <br />
          <br />
          After showcasing her flawless dance techniques world-wide, Kai'sa is
          ready to apply her legendary discipline and focus to all aspects of
          her life as a performing artist. She's still not sure who she'll be
          when she steps forward to shine as herself, but she's looking forward
          to the challenge of finding out.
